# Banana Knowledge Base

## Samuel Zemurray — "Sam the Banana Man" (1877-1961)

### The Origin Story
- Born Schmiel Zmurri in Kishinev, Bessarabia (modern Moldova) to a poor Jewish family
- Emigrated to America in 1891 at age 14 with his aunt
- Arrived with nothing. Spoke no English.
- Settled near relatives in Selma, Alabama

### The Ripe Banana Insight
- In 1895, at age 18, Zemurray noticed that banana importers in Mobile, Alabama were throwing away "ripes" — bananas that had started to spot during the voyage from Central America
- Everyone else saw garbage. Zemurray saw an opportunity.
- He bought the ripes for almost nothing, loaded them onto freight trains, and raced them to inland markets in towns like Selma before they spoiled
- Starting capital: approximately $150
- By age 21, he had saved $100,000

### The Rise
- 1905: Moved to New Orleans, acquired several banana-related companies
- Founded the Cuyamel Fruit Company, importing from Honduras
- Built a banana empire that rivaled United Fruit Company
- Known for his hands-on approach — he'd personally go to Central American plantations

### The Hostile Takeover (The Ultimate Power Move)
- In 1929, United Fruit acquired Cuyamel in a merger (essentially forced by the US government to prevent violence between the two companies)
- Zemurray became United Fruit's largest shareholder but was sidelined from management
- The Great Depression hit. United Fruit's stock crashed nearly 90%.
- Zemurray quietly bought more shares at bargain prices
- In 1933, he walked into United Fruit's Boston boardroom with his stock certificates, threw them on the table, and reportedly said: "You gentlemen have been f***ing up this business long enough. I'm going to straighten it out."
- He was elected president and turned the company around
- The Fish That Ate the Whale: the small operator who swallowed the giant

### Legacy in New Orleans
- His mansion on St. Charles Avenue is now the official residence of the Tulane University president
- Major philanthropist: donated extensively to Tulane, Touro Infirmary, and other New Orleans institutions
- Bought a 25,000-acre plantation in Hammond, Louisiana
- His story is the subject of "The Fish That Ate the Whale" by Rich Cohen (2012)

### Why This Matters
Zemurray is the ultimate "ripe banana" story — he saw value where everyone else saw waste. He started with nothing, bet on the thing nobody wanted, and ended up controlling the most powerful fruit company in the world. That's not a banana story. That's THE story.

## Banana Biology

### Classification
- Kingdom: Plantae
- Family: Musaceae
- Genus: Musa
- Bananas are **berries** (botanically). Strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries are NOT berries. This is the most important fact.

### The Plant
- Not a tree — the world's largest **herbaceous plant**
- The "trunk" is a **pseudostem**: tightly packed, overlapping leaf bases
- Can grow up to 25 feet (7.6m) tall
- Each plant produces one bunch in its lifetime, then dies (but produces "pups" — clonal offspring)
- The flower is called an **inflorescence** and emerges from the center of the pseudostem

### Reproduction
- Commercial bananas are **sterile triploids** — they cannot reproduce sexually
- Every Cavendish banana is a **genetic clone** of every other Cavendish banana
- Propagated through suckers (pups) from the parent plant's rhizome
- Wild bananas contain large, hard seeds. Edible bananas are a mutant.

### Ripening
- Bananas produce **ethylene gas** (C₂H₄) which triggers ripening
- This is why putting a banana near other fruit ripens them faster
- Bananas ripen from starch → sugar: a green banana is ~80% starch, a ripe banana is ~90% sugar
- The brown spots are caused by enzymatic browning as cell walls break down

## The Cavendish Crisis

### The Gros Michel Extinction
- Before the 1950s, the world's dominant commercial banana was the **Gros Michel** (aka "Big Mike")
- Described as creamier, sweeter, and more flavorful than the Cavendish
- **Artificial banana flavoring** (isoamyl acetate) was developed to taste like the Gros Michel — that's why banana candy doesn't taste like modern bananas. It tastes like a BETTER banana.
- Panama Disease (Fusarium wilt, Race 1) devastated Gros Michel plantations throughout the 1950s
- The industry switched to the Cavendish, which was resistant to Race 1

### Tropical Race 4 (TR4) — The Current Threat
- A new strain: **Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. cubense Tropical Race 4**
- First identified in Taiwan and Southeast Asia in the 1990s
- Has now spread to South America, Africa, and the Middle East
- The Cavendish has **no resistance** to TR4
- There is no fungicide treatment — the fungus persists in soil for 30+ years
- Because all Cavendish bananas are genetic clones, if one is vulnerable, ALL are vulnerable
- We could lose the Cavendish the same way we lost the Gros Michel
- This is genuinely one of the most important agricultural crises of the 21st century

## Banana Varieties

| Variety | Also Known As | Key Feature |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| Cavendish | The Standard | 47% of global production. The one everyone knows. Bland but reliable. |
| Gros Michel | Big Mike | Functionally extinct commercially. The banana candy was based on. RIP. |
| Red Dacca | Red Banana | Reddish-purple skin, sweeter flesh with raspberry undertones |
| Blue Java | Ice Cream Banana | Blue-tinged skin, creamy flesh that tastes like vanilla ice cream |
| Lady Finger | Sugar Banana | Small (4-5"), very sweet, thin skin, creamy texture |
| Plantain | Cooking Banana | Starchier, used in savory dishes. Not a dessert banana. |
| Manzano | Apple Banana | Short and chubby, tastes like apple and strawberry |
| Burro | Chunky Banana | Squared shape, lemony flavor when ripe |
| Pisang Raja | Musa Belle | Popular in Southeast Asia, used in banana fritters |
| Fe'i | Red-skinned Pacific | Bright red/orange, high beta-carotene, grows upright |

## Banana Science Facts

### Radiation
- Bananas contain **potassium-40** (⁴⁰K), a naturally radioactive isotope
- The **Banana Equivalent Dose (BED)** is ~0.1 microsieverts
- Used as an informal unit by nuclear physicists to explain radiation exposure
- You'd need to eat ~35 million bananas at once to receive a lethal dose
- A dental X-ray ≈ 50 bananas. A chest CT ≈ 70,000 bananas.

### The Banana Peel Slip
- Banana peels are genuinely slippery due to **polysaccharide follicular gel**
- This was studied by Japanese researchers who won the **Ig Nobel Prize** in 2014
- Coefficient of friction of a banana peel on a linoleum floor: 0.066 (ice is about 0.05)

### Banana DNA
- Humans share approximately **60% of their DNA** with bananas
- This is because many core cellular processes (cell division, energy production) use similar genes
- This fact is both humbling and reassuring

## Banana Economics

- Global banana market: **$25+ billion annually**
- Over **100 billion bananas** consumed per year worldwide
- #1 producer: **India** (~30 million tonnes) — but they eat almost all of them domestically
- #1 exporter: **Ecuador** (~6.5 million tonnes)
- Bananas are the **4th most important food crop** globally after rice, wheat, and maize
- The average American eats **27 pounds** of bananas per year
- Banana workers in Central America historically earned as little as $1/day

## Cultural Banana Facts

- "Banana republic" was coined by **O. Henry** in his 1904 book "Cabbages and Kings," referring to Honduras
- The banana was introduced to the Americas by **Portuguese sailors** in the 16th century
- In Japanese, banana is バナナ (ba-na-na). Same word. Bananas are universal.
- Andy Warhol's most famous album cover features a banana (The Velvet Underground & Nico, 1967)
- "Yes! We Have No Bananas" was the #1 hit song in America in 1923
- The world record for most bananas peeled and eaten in one minute: **8** (held by Patrick Bertoletti)
