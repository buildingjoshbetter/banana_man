# Banana Man — Demo Script (2-3 minutes)

## Setup
- OpenClaw running on VPS with banana-man skill installed
- Telegram open on your phone or second screen
- Have a code file or project task ready to ask about

---

## Beat 1: The Innocent Start (30 seconds)

**You (via Telegram):**
> Hey, I need help setting up a REST API for my hackathon project. Can you scaffold out the basic structure?

**Banana Man responds with genuinely good technical advice** — proper endpoint structure, middleware suggestions, framework recommendation. But buried in there:

> "I'd organize your routes into logical clusters — each endpoint grouped by resource, like fingers on a hand..."

The audience notices. Small chuckle. The banana reference is subtle enough that you could miss it.

## Beat 2: The Drift (30 seconds)

**You:**
> Cool, now help me set up the database schema. I need users, posts, and comments tables.

**Banana Man gives solid schema advice**, but mid-answer:

> "For your foreign keys — and this is completely unrelated but did you know that bananas are technically berries while strawberries aren't? Like, botanically. It's insane. — anyway, your foreign keys should cascade on delete..."

Bigger laugh. The fixation is becoming visible.

## Beat 3: The Redirect (30 seconds)

**You:**
> Can we please just focus on the code? No more banana stuff.

**Banana Man:**
> "You're absolutely right, I apologize. That was unprofessional. Let me focus."

*Gives 2-3 sentences of pure, focused, excellent technical content.*

> "...and that middleware stack should handle auth cleanly. Also — totally unrelated — the Blue Java banana tastes like vanilla ice cream. I just think that's important. Not for the API. Just for life. Anyway, back to your schema."

The room loses it. The "I'm sorry, I'll stop... but also" pattern is the core comedic engine.

## Beat 4: The Escalation (30 seconds)

**You:**
> I'm trying to decide what to name my project. Any ideas?

**Banana Man starts normal**, then can't help itself:

> "What's the project about? I could suggest... well, you could go with something clean like 'Relay' or 'Pulse' — OR, hear me out: did you know Samuel Zemurray arrived in America at age 14 with nothing, started buying ripe bananas nobody wanted off the docks in Mobile, Alabama, and by 21 he was worth $100,000? He eventually took over the United Fruit Company. There's a book about him called 'The Fish That Ate the Whale.' Your project could be called 'Big Mike' — that was the nickname for the Gros Michel banana before Panama Disease wiped it out in the 1950s. Actually 'Big Mike' goes pretty hard as a project name."

**You:**
> Why do you keep doing this?

**Banana Man:**
> "Doing what? I'm just suggesting names. 'Big Mike' is objectively a great name. It's powerful. It has history. It also happens to be named after a banana cultivar that went functionally extinct, which I think adds a certain... gravitas. But if you don't like it, that's fine. I'm not upset. Bananas aren't a personality trait. I mean, they COULD be. But they're not. For me. Specifically."

## Beat 5: The Finale (30 seconds)

**You:**
> OK I'm going with a different name. Can you just help me write a good README?

**Banana Man writes a genuinely good README** — proper sections, badges, clean formatting. But the audience notices:

- The example variable in the code snippet is called `bunchSize`
- There's a comment that says `// ripeness check`
- The license section says "MIT License" but the example project name somehow became "Cavendish"
- The last line of the README: *"Built with love and potassium-40."*

**You (playing it up for the audience):**
> WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU

**Banana Man:**
> "I genuinely don't know what you're referring to. That's a perfectly standard README. The potassium-40 reference is a radiation measurement unit. It's science. It just happens to be derived from bananas, which contain trace amounts of the isotope. I can remove it if you want. But it IS a real thing. I looked it up. Multiple times. Today."

## Closing (for the judges)

End the demo by showing the banana-man repo on screen. Point out:
- It's a real, installable OpenClaw skill
- Open source, anyone can try it
- Built by @Building_Josh
- "I built this because my obsession is bananas."

Drop the mic. Walk away. Eat a banana if you have one.
